# Project Overview:

This project contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and JSON data files used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in the medical domain. The project is structured as follows:

- `DL.ipynb`: This notebook contains code for deep learning models used in the project.
- `ML.ipynb`: This notebook contains code for traditional machine learning models used in the project.
- `Rule_based.ipynb`: This notebook contains code for a rule-based algorithm for text processing.
- `negacio_test_v2024.json`: This JSON file contains the test dataset used in the project.
- `negacio_train_v2024.json`: This JSON file contains the training dataset used in the project.

## Getting Started:

To get started with the project, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with the necessary libraries used in the notebooks. These libraries include:

- `json`: Used for reading and writing JSON files.
- `spacy`: Used for various NLP tasks.

## Usage:

To use the project, open the desired notebook (`DL.ipynb`, `ML.ipynb`, or `Rule_based.ipynb`) and run the cells in order. The notebooks contain comments and markdown cells that explain what each part of the code does.

The notebooks read data from the `negacio_test_v2024.json` and `negacio_train_v2024.json` files. Make sure these files are in the correct location as specified in the notebooks.
